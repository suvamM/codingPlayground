# Coding Playground
An experimental playground, where I provide implementations of various data structures and algorithm problems. You might find some of these libraries useful for your own programs (though I test them as thoroughly as possible, still no warranties!). Or you might some of the programs useful if you are preparing for a coding interview. In any case, contributions are welcome!

## Java Collections
Important Java collections Interface: List, Set, Map.

### List
- `add`
- `contains`
- `get`
- `indexOf`
- `isEmpty`
- `remove`
- `size`

`ArrayList` is an implementing class.

### Set
- `add`
- `contains`
- `isEmpty`
- `remove`
- `size`

`HashSet` is an implementing class.

### Map
- `containsKey`
- `containsValue`
- `get`
- `isEmpty`
- `keySet`
- `put` : if the key already exists, this API replaces the value
- `size`
- `values`
